No shade but you gonna see
How you gonna through dirt on my name jeez? Nigga please
I know that you proud of me
Sprouting from the underground through the concrete
Baby go slow when you riding me
Take your time with me
Making honey drip down like a bumblebee
Fuck me like she proud of me
They waiting to see
All eyes still on me
But I know somewhere you so proud of me (of me)
It's all I can see
Means so much to me
Holding hands when I need a break
I don't know how much more I can take
Need to meditate, no, never go away
Trying to be my best, what more can I say?
Yeah I'm on the road but I'm not alone
Told you on the phone
If you need it and I got it, no, it's not a loan
Want to help before I go
They waiting to see
All eyes still on me
But I know somewhere you so proud of me (of me)
It's all I can see
Means so much to me
Remember waiting for ya at the train stop
I put new songs on my iPod
I wanna show 'em to ya, I like what you think
I like when you smile, when you hear me sing
Remember back then? We was burning through
packs on the corner like some gargoyles laughing
Pigybacking, you was proud
After the show, you took me out
They waiting to see
All eyes still on me
But I know somewhere you so proud of me (of me)
It's all I can see
Means so much to me
Clouds broke, now it's raining on me
My ancestors, yeah, they watch over me
Watering me
Watching me grow
