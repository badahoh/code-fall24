Low
Got me running on E
All this pressure on me
Got me wishing I was six feet deep
In the yard
Somebody checking for me
In the streets
Whippin' 'round California
In the car
Windows down
Top down
I know you feel me now
I know you feel me now

I'll go faster
Than them demons chasing after
Our art, our laughter
I said "baby, what happened?"
Now we overreacting (What's wrong?)
Last one
Jump in, be the captain (Shit)

Low
Got me running on E
All this pressure on me
Got me wishing I was six feet deep
In the yard
Somebody checking for me
In the streets
Whippin' 'round California
In the car
Windows down
Top down
I know you feel me now
I know you feel me now

Patience
Build my house out of brick
Evenings
In the lot learning stick
I never got it down no it never made sense
Fast forward
Ended up with it
Automatic

I need to let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
