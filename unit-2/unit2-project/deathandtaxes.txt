I live in the real world, I've lost my faith
Surely we'll live to see the day
When all of our problems, they fade away
Only two things in this life that are sure
Of that I'm sure
Only two things in this life that are sure
Of that I'm sure
Only two things in this life that are sure
Of that I'm sure
Surely my sins have found me out
Only two things in this life that are sure,
Of that I'm sure
Death and taxes
