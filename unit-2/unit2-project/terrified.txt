You by the light is the greatest find
In a world full wrong you're the thing that's right
Finally made it through the lonely to the other side
You said it again, my heart's in motion
Every word feels like a shooting star
I'm at the edge of my emotions
Watching the shadows burning in the dark
And I'm in love
And I'm terrified
For the first time and the last time in my only life
This could be good, it's already better than that
And nothing's worse than knowing you're holding back
I could be all that you needed if you let me try
You said it again my heart's in motion
Every word feels like a shooting star
I'm at the edge of my emotions
Watching the shadows burning in the dark
And I'm in love
And I'm terrified
For the first time and the last time in my only
I only said it 'cause I mean it, oh
I only mean 'cause it's true
So don't you doubt what I've been dreamin'
'Cause it fills me up and holds me close whenever I'm without you
You said it again my heart's in motion
Every word feels like a shooting star
Watching the shadows burning in the dark
And I'm in love
And I'm terrified
For the first time and the last time in my only life, life, life
In my only life
