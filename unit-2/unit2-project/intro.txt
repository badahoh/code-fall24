I'll be on the way
Only want the best for you
If you wanna stay
Only give my best to you
If you wanna go
I wish the best for you, mm-hm
I'll be on the way
Only want the best for you
If you wanna stay
Only give my best to you
If you wanna go
I wish the best for you, mm-hm
I keep your picture in my phone case sometimes
Metallic moonshine, paint the highway, tears on my face
There's beauty in all of the small things
You crash and you burn 'til you live and you learn and you stay
I'll be on the way
Only want the best for you
If you wanna stay
Only give my best to you
If you wanna go
I wish the best for you, mm-hm
I'll be on the way
Only want the best for you
If you wanna stay
Only give my best to you
If you wanna go
I wish the best for you, mm-hm
How the sun still up in the night time? (All night)
Am I running out of lifelines?
Is it weak when I say that I need you?
Long drives under stars, ceiling see-through
We sharing fries at the drive-thru
Thinking one day, I'ma wife you
Joking 'round 'cause I'm scared it'll scare you
Look at everything we've been through
Oh, oh, oh
The silence split the car in two
I don't wanna hear no bad news
Bad news
I'll be on the way
Only want the best for you
If you wanna stay
Only give my best to you
If you wanna go
I wish the best for you, mm-hm
I'll be on the way
Only want the best for you
If you wanna stay
Only give my best to you
If you wanna go
I wish the best for you, mm-hm
