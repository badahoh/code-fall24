# start with sample folder 
# three folders with seperate images 
# 2 algorithms 
# pushed up to github before deadline 
# make folders that are themed 
# run algorithm on three folders separately 
 
# cute 
# sea creatures 
# baked goods 
# crayon shin chen
# combined or collaged sea creatures in the ocean
# perhaps including different color patterns and changing hue of pictures 
# create 3 different folders 
# gather images in each folder naming them with their themes 
# python file that randomly selects photos from this folder and combines them 
# manipulate images using codes from previous assignment
# apply same algorithm to 


#1. find a bunch of images (10)
#2.test data folder 
#3 1. file for first algorithm 2nd file for second algorithm 
#4 cd final project touch algo1.py touch algo2.py 
#5 drag folder into vs code and first import puthon image library 
#6 in algo 1 (import sys library)
#7 write a for loop that gets data from images-0 folder 
# change the top left corner, 40 pixel by 40 pixel 
# make those pixels red 
# save that image as algo-1.jpg  


# algo 2 import pillow 
# import random 
# write series of commands 
# gets 1 random image 
#decreases opacity of image 
# gets another image 
#decreases the opacity 
# puts second image over fist image 
# but pastes it so that it only covers the left 30% of the
